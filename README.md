# Weather API Subscription Service

This repository contains a backend implemented according to the [task](https://github.com/mykhailo-hrynko/se-school-5/tree/task-description), which provides the ability to obtain weather information (weatherapi.com), subscribe to weather, as well as a frontend for more visual testing.

## Demo

- [FrontEnd](http://217.78.237.105/)
- [Backend](http://217.78.237.105:3000/api/weather?city=Kyiv)

3.  [Getting Started](#getting-started)
4.  [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)

## Task Requirements

- ✅ The app implemented with `Node.js`, `PHP` or `Golang` using any libraries or frameworks.
- ✅ Migrations to setup initial `PostgreSQL` DB structure.
- ✅ `readme.md` file explainig what was done and how to run the app locally
- ✅ `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run the app with a single `docker compose up` command

### Extras

- ✅ deploy your API to some hosting (e.g., [Render](https://render.com/docs/docker))
- ✅ Create a simple HTML page to initiate the subscription
- Cover the API with functional tests

## Technology Stack & Rationale

### Core Technologies

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Web Framework:** Express.js
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Email Service:** Nodemailer
- **Task Scheduling:** node-cron
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier

### Why This Stack?

The technology stack was chosen to balance development speed, type safety, maintainability, and modern best practices for a Node.js backend.

## Getting Started

### Running with Docker **(Recommended)**

1.  **Clone the repository (if not already done).**

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (`gses-5/`). This file will be used by `compose.yaml`. Refer to the [Environment Variables](#root-folder-env---docker-compose) section.

3.  **Build and start the services:**
    From the root directory of the project (`gses-5/`):

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    To run in detached mode:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

4.  **To stop the services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose stop
    ```

5.  **To down the services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/volodymyr-malishevskyi/gses-5
    cd gses-5/backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Populate it based on the [Environment Variables](#backend-folder-env---for-local-development) section or an `.env.example` file if provided.

4.  **Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible.**
    You can use a local PostgreSQL installation or a Docker container. Update `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file accordingly.

5.  **Apply database migrations:**

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

    (If you've changed the output location for Prisma Client, you might need to run `npx prisma generate` first.)

6.  **Run the application in development mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This typically uses `tsc-watch` or `nodemon` for auto-recompilation and server restart on file changes.

7.  **To run a production build locally (after `npm run build`):**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory (for Docker Compose) or `backend` directory (for local `npm run dev/start`) with the following variables:

### Backend Folder .ENV - For local development

```sh
PORT=3030

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5434/weather?schema=public

# https://www.weatherapi.com/my/
WEATHER_API_KEY=

# The App Url to which the redirect will be made from email
APP_URL=http://localhost:3030

SMTP_FROM=Weather App <noreply@weather.app
SMTP_USER=email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=password

# Cron jobs described in JSON format for subscription types:
# type - cron rule
BROADCAST_CRONS=[["daily", "0 8 * * *"],["hourly", "0 * * * *"]]
```

### Root Folder .ENV - Docker Compose

```sh
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=weather

# https://www.weatherapi.com/my/
WEATHER_API_KEY=

# GOOGLE SMTP Credentials (working with 2FA and App Password)
SMTP_FROM=Weather App <noreply@weather.app>
SMTP_USER=email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=password

# Cron jobs described in JSON format for subscription types:
# type - cron rule
BROADCAST_CRONS=[["daily", "0 0 * * *"],["hourly", "0 * * * *"]]
```
